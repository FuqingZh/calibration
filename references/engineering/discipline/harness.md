# Repository Agent Harness

Use this reference when an agent repeatedly stalls, rediscovers the same
operation, lacks feedback, or cannot reliably navigate and complete work in a
repository.

The goal is to identify the missing repository capability and place it at the
lowest durable layer that can provide it. Do not default to adding prompt text.

## Missing Capability Diagnosis

| Observed gap | Prefer |
| --- | --- |
| Facts or authority are hard to find | repository map, current docs, or generated reference |
| A repeated operation is hard to execute | repository script, tool, or stable command |
| Correctness cannot be decided | test, grader, acceptance fixture, or explicit contract |
| Runtime state cannot be observed | logs, metrics, traces, screenshots, or inspectable artifacts |
| A boundary is repeatedly violated | lint, structural test, schema, or typed interface |
| A task cannot survive interruption or handoff | durable task state, isolated workspace, or orchestration |

Confirm the gap from actual failures, review feedback, or repeated task
evidence. A longer instruction is not a substitute for a missing capability.

## Placement Ladder

Place each learned capability with the owner able to keep it current and, when
possible, enforce it:

| Knowledge or capability | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Temporary observation | current task or `.traces/` |
| Stable project fact or boundary | project documentation |
| Repeated project operation | repository script or tool |
| Mechanically decidable invariant | test, lint, schema check, or CI |
| Representative output-quality problem | evaluation case and rubric |
| Cross-project engineering judgment | calibration |
| Private direction or personal progress | private planning or memory surface |

Memory and conversation may identify where to look, but current repository,
environment, and external-system evidence remain authoritative.

## `AGENTS.md` Contract

Treat `AGENTS.md` as an operational map for an agent entering a repository or
subtree. Include only repository-specific information needed to find authority
and execute work, such as:

- a compact repository or subtree map;
- links to current architecture, testing, planning, and deployment authority;
- environment entrypoints and canonical verification commands;
- external resources, dangerous operations, and permission boundaries;
- repository-local exceptions to broader defaults.

Keep root and nested scopes explicit. Point to `docs/README.md` when the
repository has one. Do not copy architecture prose, test matrices, temporary
task state, generic engineering guidance, or source articles into
`AGENTS.md`. A repository with no useful local increment may omit it.

## Harness Levels

Scale the harness to the repository's actual failure and delivery surface:

- **Small public library:** README, focused CI, tests, build, and publish
  checks are usually sufficient.
- **Business or domain repository:** add an authority map, canonical verify
  path, representative fixtures, and explicit external boundaries.
- **Application or pipeline:** add isolated environments, runtime
  observability, end-to-end checks, deployment verification, and readback of
  externally visible effects.

Do not import application-scale orchestration or observability into a small
library without evidence that its current feedback loop is inadequate.

## Human Escalation

Escalate decisions that require human authority:

- product intent and priority;
- scope, interface, or compatibility tradeoffs;
- risk acceptance;
- irreversible or high-impact external operations;
- judgment that remains materially underdetermined after safe evidence
  gathering.

Resolve facts available from the repository, environment, documentation, or
tools before asking the user. Present the checked evidence when a remaining
judgment is escalated.

## Orchestration Adoption Gate

Consider a durable `WORKFLOW.md` or Symphony-style orchestrator only when all
relevant prerequisites exist:

- parallel task volume creates material context-switching or coordination
  cost;
- agents must claim, resume, retry, or continuously advance work;
- issue or task state is stable enough to act as a state machine;
- per-task workspaces and permission boundaries are reliable;
- an actual orchestrator will execute the contract.

Without those conditions, use ordinary short-lived tasks, Worktrees, scripts,
and platform-native PR state. Do not create a decorative workflow contract.

## Completion

Complete a harness change only when the observed gap, selected owner, smallest
capability, and verification path are explicit. Evaluate representative
behavior separately when claiming the system became more effective.
