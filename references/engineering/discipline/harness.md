# Repository Agent Harness

Use this reference when an agent repeatedly stalls, rediscovers the same
operation, lacks feedback, or cannot reliably navigate and complete work in a
repository.

The goal is to identify the missing repository capability and place it at the
lowest durable layer that can provide it. Do not default to adding prompt text.

## Missing Capability Diagnosis

| Observed gap | Prefer |
| --- | --- |
| Facts or authority are hard to find | repository map, current docs, or generated reference |
| A repeated operation is hard to execute | repository script, tool, or stable command |
| Correctness cannot be decided | test, grader, acceptance fixture, or explicit contract |
| Runtime state cannot be observed | logs, metrics, traces, screenshots, or inspectable artifacts |
| A boundary is repeatedly violated | lint, structural test, schema, or typed interface |
| A task cannot survive interruption or handoff | durable task state, isolated workspace, or orchestration |

Confirm the gap from actual failures, review feedback, or repeated task
evidence. A longer instruction is not a substitute for a missing capability.

## Placement Ladder

Place each learned capability with the owner able to keep it current and, when
possible, enforce it:

| Knowledge or capability | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Temporary observation | current task or `.traces/` |
| Stable project fact or boundary | project documentation |
| Repeated project operation | repository script or tool |
| Mechanically decidable invariant | test, lint, schema check, or CI |
| Representative output-quality problem | evaluation case and rubric |
| Cross-project engineering judgment | calibration |
| Private direction or personal progress | private planning or memory surface |

Memory and conversation may identify where to look, but current repository,
environment, and external-system evidence remain authoritative.

## `AGENTS.md` Contract

Treat `AGENTS.md` as an operational map for an agent entering a repository or
subtree. Include only repository-specific information needed to find authority
and execute work, such as:

- a compact repository or subtree map;
- links to current architecture, testing, planning, and deployment authority;
- environment entrypoints and canonical verification commands;
- external resources, dangerous operations, and permission boundaries;
- repository-local exceptions to broader defaults.

Keep root and nested scopes explicit. Point to `docs/README.md` when the
repository has one. Do not copy architecture prose, test matrices, temporary
task state, generic engineering guidance, or source articles into
`AGENTS.md`. A repository with no useful local increment may omit it.

## Harness Proportionality

Start from the repository's current feedback loop. Add the smallest capability
that addresses an observed gap, verify that it changes the failure mode, and
stop when the loop is adequate. Repository category or size does not imply a
mandatory harness checklist.

## Human Escalation

Escalate only decisions that require human authority:

- product intent and priority;
- scope, interface, or compatibility tradeoffs;
- risk acceptance;
- irreversible or high-impact external operations;
- judgment that remains materially underdetermined after safe evidence
  gathering.

When escalation remains after safe evidence gathering, present the checked
evidence, the unresolved decision, and a recommendation.

## Orchestration Adoption Gate

Consider a durable `WORKFLOW.md` or Symphony-style orchestrator only when all
relevant prerequisites exist:

- parallel task volume creates material context-switching or coordination
  cost;
- agents must claim, resume, retry, or continuously advance work;
- issue or task state is stable enough to act as a state machine;
- per-task workspaces and permission boundaries are reliable;
- an actual orchestrator will execute the contract.

Without those conditions, use ordinary short-lived tasks, Worktrees, scripts,
and platform-native PR state. Do not create a decorative workflow contract.

## Completion

Complete a harness change only when the observed gap, selected owner, smallest
capability, and verification path are explicit. Evaluate representative
behavior separately when claiming the system became more effective.
